# bank_loan_analysis
## 📌 Overview
This project is focused on analyzing loan application data to understand lending trends, borrower profiles, loan quality, and repayment behavior.  
The work is being done in three phases:
1. **SQL Data Analysis** – Completed ✅
2. **Power BI Dashboarding** – In Progress ⏳
3. **Machine Learning Modeling** – Planned 🔜

## 🗄️ SQL Data Analysis
The SQL analysis involves querying a loan dataset to extract meaningful insights.  
Key areas covered so far:
- **Application Trends** – Month-on-month growth in loan applications and funded amounts.  
- **Funding & Repayments** – Total loan funding vs. repayments received.  
- **Loan Quality** – Good vs. bad loan distribution by application count and value.  
- **Loan Status Breakdown** – Fully paid, charged-off, and current loans.  
- **Borrower Profiles** – Employment length, purpose of loan, and home ownership.  
- **Term Length Analysis** – Preference for 36 vs. 60-month loans.  

Each query result is summarized at the end of the SQL file with explanatory insights.

## 📊 Power BI (Coming Soon)
Planned work:
- Interactive dashboards to visualize trends (applications, funding, repayments).  
- Drill-downs by loan purpose, borrower profiles, and repayment performance.  
- KPI tracking for portfolio health.

## 🤖 Machine Learning (Future Scope)
Planned work:
- Predictive modeling for loan default risk.  
- Feature engineering from borrower and loan attributes.  

---

## 🚀 Next Steps
- Refine SQL queries and insights.  
- Build Power BI dashboards for better visualization.  
- Begin machine learning model development.
